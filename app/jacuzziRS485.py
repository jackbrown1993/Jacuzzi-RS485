""" This module extends balboa.py to work instead with Jacuzzi
spas. 

It uses an old version of pybalboa (https://github.com/garbled1/pybalboa)

I chose to extend pybalboa so that I could leverage the already-proven
WiFi and protocol parsing behavior in pybalboa. This dependency turns
out to be pretty light; it would not take major effort to decouple
jacuzziRS485.py from pybalboa. Still, I am deeply indebted to 

garbled1 (https://github.com/garbled1/pybalboa)
natekspencer (https://github.com/natekspencer)
ccutrer (https://github.com/ccutrer/balboa_worldwide_app/wiki)
hyperactivej (https://github.com/HyperActiveJ)
dhmsjs (https://github.com/dhmsjs)

along with several others here unnamed, who have helped reverse engineer
balboa hot tub control systems and their many rebranded derivatives.
