""" This module extends balboa.py to work instead with Jacuzzi
spas. 

It uses pybalboa-0.13 from https://github.com/garbled1/pybalboa.

I chose to extend pybalboa so that I could leverage the already-proven
WiFi and protocol parsing behavior in pybalboa. This dependency turns
out to be pretty light; it would not take major effort to decouple
jacuzzi.py from pybalboa. Still, I am deeply indebted to 

garbled1 (https://github.com/garbled1/pybalboa)
natekspencer (https://github.com/natekspencer)
ccutrer (https://github.com/ccutrer/balboa_worldwide_app/wiki)

along with several others here unnamed, who have helped reverse engineer
balboa hot tub control systems and their many rebranded derivatives.

Note that as of Jan 2023 pybalboa has undergone significant revisions
beyond version 0.13. I doubt jacuzzi.py will work with anything later than
v0.13 without careful attention -- which given the light dependency, is
probably not worth the effort.
