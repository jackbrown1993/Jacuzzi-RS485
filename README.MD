# Jacuzzi App

This repo is still under development.

Inspired from:

## Purpose:

To remotely control the Jacuzzi J335 without the expensive SmartTub module and celluar subscription. An RS485 Serial to WiFi adaptor is used instead connected to the RS485 port on the main board. The adaptor I used was around Â£25 on Amazon.co.uk (https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B097C8PT6F).


## Configuration:

### Mandatory ENV variables:

`MQTT_HOST` - DNS or IP of your MQTT server.

`MQTT_PORT` - Port that your MQTT server is listening on.

`MQTT_USER` - Username of MQTT server.

`MQTT_PASSWORD` - Password of MQTT server.

`SERIAL_IP` - IP address of your Elfin serial to WiFi device.

`SERIAL_PORT` - Port that the NETP service of your serial to WiFi device is running on.

### Optional ENV vars:


## MQTT

An MQTT Bridge is provided to allow easy integration with other systems. You will need a separate MQTT server running (Mosquitto is a relatively easy and robust one). The MQTT topics follow the Homie convention, making them self-describing.

Publishing a float value to ```homie/hot_tub/J335/set_temperature/set``` will change the set temp value of Jacuzzi.

## Docker:

Run docker image using ```docker run -d -e MQTT_HOST= -e MQTT_PORT=1883 -e MQTT_USER= -e MQTT_PASSWORD= -e SERIAL_IP= -e SERIAL_PORT=8899 ghcr.io/jackbrown1993/jacuzzi-rs485:latest```

### docker-compose Example:

```
version: '3.8'
services:

  jacuzzi-rs485:
    image: ghcr.io/jackbrown1993/jacuzzi-rs485:latest
    container_name: jacuzzi
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - MQTT_HOST=
      - MQTT_PORT=1883
      - MQTT_USER=
      - MQTT_PASSWORD=
      - SERIAL_IP=
      - SERIAL_PORT=8899
```
## Code Quality Checks

When pull requests are opened a Github action is used to ensure code quality:
- Black to ensure code is formatted,
- Pylint to disallow unused imports, and
- Mypy for type checking. (Currently disabled)
